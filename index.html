                This is where I did my early education. 
                <br>The varied nationality of my peers, 
                <br>forced me to speak english 
                <br>and hence I build a solid foundation of both my 
                <br>academics and speaking skills.

                This is the school I attended after 
                <br>coming back home to Trivandrum. 
                <br>The lush atmosphere and a tight group of freinds,  
                <br>made me really enjoy my middle 
                <br>and early high school years.

                This is where I spent the rest of my schhol years
                <br>At the time, when studying was a priority, 
                <br>the school allowed us to work on many 
                <br>extra-carricular 
                activities which really opened up 
                <br>my eyes to coding and how much fun it was!

            My brand new jouney into a professional degree has begun 
            <br>and so far its been absolutly fanrastic 
            <br>and hectic at the same time. I plan to do many things while 
            <br>here in college. I suppose the biggest challenge will be to 
            <br>manage academics and other stuff!
